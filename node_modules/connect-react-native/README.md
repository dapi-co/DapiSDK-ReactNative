Financial APIs to connect users' bank accounts

## Introduction

Dapi for React-Native is a prebuilt SDK that reduces the time it takes to integrate with Dapi's API and gain access to your users financial data.

The SDK provides direct access to Dapi endpoints and offers optional UI to manage users' accounts and money transfer.

## Integration

You can check out our [React-Native Integration Guide](https://dapi-api.readme.io/docs/how-to-integrate-with-reactnative-sdk) for detailed information about our SDK.
